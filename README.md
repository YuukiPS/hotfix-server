# Server & Downloader for Hotfix
as described, Basically this is to run a hotfix server for backup or use for localhost so that you don't have to download repeatedly, which is quite useful for mobile users and downloading hotfixes from the official server.
## How run ?
just clone it and run `./run.sh cloud` or use docker compose. then use the `/gi` or `/sr` command to download data from the official server.
